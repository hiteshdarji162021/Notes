# What covered in notes

- Playwright setup

## Step 1️⃣ Initialize Node Project

Open terminal inside your project folder and run:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create:

- `package.json`

---

## Step 2️⃣ Initialize Playwright

Run the Playwright setup command:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

During setup:

- Select **TypeScript**
- Choose **tests folder** (default recommended)
- Select browsers as required

---

## Step 3️⃣ Verify Playwright Version

```bash
npx playwright --version
```

Confirms Playwright is installed correctly.

---

## Step 4️⃣ Install Required Dev Dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test typescript ts-node
```

These are required for:

- Playwright test runner
- TypeScript support
- Running TS files

---

## Step 5️⃣ Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

This downloads:

- Chromium
- Firefox
- WebKit

---

## Step 6️⃣ Create `tsconfig.json`

Create a file named **`tsconfig.json`** in the root folder and **copy–paste** below configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "types": ["node", "@playwright/test"]
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"]
}
```

## Step 7️⃣ npm vs npx (Important for Interviews)

### 1️⃣ npm (Node Package Manager)

**Purpose:**

- Used to install, update, and remove packages

**Main work:**

- Installs packages and saves them inside `node_modules`

**Common commands:**

```bash
npm install playwright
npm install -D typescript
npm uninstall lodash
```

**When to use `npm`:**

- When you want a package **permanently** in your project
- When the package is used **again and again**

---

### 2️⃣ npx (Node Package Execute)

**Purpose:**

- Used to **run / execute a package directly** without installing it globally

**Common commands:**

```bash
npx playwright install
npx playwright test
npx tsc --init
```

**When to use `npx`:**

- One-time execution
- Running project-local binaries
- Avoid global installs

### 3️⃣ npm vs npx – Quick Comparison

| Point                 | npm                   | npx                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Full form             | Node Package Manager  | Node Package Execute |
| Main job              | Install packages      | Run packages         |
| Global install needed | Sometimes             | No                   |
| Adds to package.json  | Yes                   | No                   |
| node_modules usage    | Yes                   | Temporary / Local    |
| Best use case         | Dependency management | One-time execution   |

### Interview One-Liner

> **npm is used to install packages, while npx is used to execute packages directly without global installation.**

## Summary ✅

- Playwright setup completed
- TypeScript configured
- Browsers installed
- npm vs npx clearly understood
