## What Covered in This Canvas
- Where Python is used (real-world)
- Python setup & installation (Windows focus)
- Verifying Python installation
- Installing & setting up PyCharm
- Creating first Python project
- Comments in Python
- Variables in Python
- Variable rules, naming conventions & dynamic typing

## 1. Where Python Is Used (Why You Are Learning It)

Python is a **general-purpose language** used across many domains:

### Major Usage Areas
- Web development (backend services)
- Data analysis & reporting
- Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
- Automation & scripting
- Desktop applications
- DevOps & Cloud automation

### Important Insight
> Python is widely used because it is **easy to write, easy to read, and easy to maintain**.

---

## 2. Python Setup – Download & Install (Windows)

### Step 1: Download Python
- Open official Python website
- Download **Python 3 (64-bit)** installer for Windows

### Step 2: Install Python
During installation:
- ✅ Select **Add Python to PATH**
- ✅ Use default installation options
- Click **Install Now**

### Default Installation Path
```
C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3xx
```

---

## 3. Verify Python Installation

Open **Command Prompt** and run:
```bash
python --version
```
OR
```bash
py --version
```

Expected Output:
```
Python 3.x.x
```

If version is shown → Python is installed correctly.

## 4. Installing PyCharm (Python IDE)

### What Is PyCharm?
- PyCharm is an **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** for Python
- Helps with writing, running, and debugging Python code

### Installation Steps
- Download **PyCharm Community Edition (Free)**
- Run installer
- Keep default settings
- Optionally add PyCharm to PATH

---

## 5. Creating First Python Project in PyCharm

### Steps
1. Open PyCharm
2. Click **New Project**
3. Select **Pure Python**
4. Choose project location
5. Select Python interpreter
6. Click **Create**

PyCharm automatically creates:
- Project folder
- Virtual environment (optional)

---

## 6. What Is Python Interpreter?

- Interpreter is the program that **executes Python code**
- PyCharm needs to know **which Python version** to use

### Common Interpreter Types
- System Python
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

---

## 7. Comments in Python

### What Are Comments?
- Non-executable text
- Ignored during runtime
- Used to explain code

### Single-Line Comment
```python
# This is a comment
```

### Multi-Line Comment
```python
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

### Uses of Comments
- Improve readability
- Explain logic
- Temporarily disable code

---

## 8. Variables in Python

### What Is a Variable?
> A variable is a **container used to store data values**.

### Example
```python
x = 10
name = "John"
```

### Important Characteristics
- No declaration keyword needed
- Created when value is assigned
- Data type is decided automatically

---

## 9. Variable Naming Rules

### Valid Rules
- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Cannot start with a number
- Can contain letters, numbers, underscore
- Case-sensitive
- Cannot be a Python keyword

### Valid Examples
```python
myvar = "John"
_myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

### Invalid Examples
```python
2myvar = "John"   # starts with number
my-var = "John"  # hyphen not allowed
my var = "John"  # space not allowed
```

---

## 10. Dynamic Typing in Python

Python is a **dynamically typed language**.

### Example
```python
x = 10        # int
x = "Hello" # now string
```

### Meaning
- Variable type is checked at runtime
- Same variable can hold different data types

---

## 11. Common Data Types (Intro Level)

| Category | Type |
|------|------|
| Text | str |
| Number | int, float |
| Boolean | bool |
| Sequence | list, tuple |
| Mapping | dict |
| Set | set |

---

## 12. First Python Program

```python
print("Hello, Python")
```

### Output
```
Hello, Python
```

---

## 13. Architect Insight (Why This Setup Matters)

- Correct installation avoids environment issues
- PATH setup prevents execution errors
- IDE + interpreter clarity improves productivity
- Clean variable usage avoids logical bugs

> Strong fundamentals lead to scalable systems.

---

## 14. Memory Hook

> Python setup → Interpreter → Variables → Logic → Programs

---
